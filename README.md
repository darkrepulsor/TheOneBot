First of all, I would like to thank devs from the-one-api, who made it possible, after all TheOneBot is powered by The One API.
    If you want to develop your own LOTR bot, feel free to know the tool that made it possible:
      https://the-one-api.dev/
    If you want to contribute with the project, here is their repo link:
      https://github.com/gitfrosh/lotr-api
This project has the purpose to develop a nice tool for groups and friends interact in Telegram.
Also I started it for studies and fun purpose.

I hope you enjoy it.

Functions:

/quote - return a random LOTR quote.
/character - return a random LOTR character.
